# **LJ Code 201 - Day 4**

## Day 3 was superrrrrr hard, first day of class where I had to stay really late, and even then I didn't totally fix my code until today in pair programming time because other matt helped e fix it all.  So I have to say I feel like I'm behind... I'm not sure if anybody else didn't finish their day 3 projects either, but with how easy it came to some people it's hard to feel like I'm doing well.  But thankfully with help and collaboration I'm back on track and on par with the rest of the class! Now I should be all set for tomorrow :)

## I really hope that it all starts clicking soon, sometimes I feel like I'm helping others whereas other times I feel like I'm extremely behind, which is probably a good balance but it does feel a little overwhelming when I can't get my code to work. I'm sure that with more experience just learning in this setting, I'll be on pace with the rest of the class soon!
