## I got an 88% on the 301 entrance exam, which is pretty good for me I think but I should've done better, there was one question I got wrong that was almost exactly like a problem on a quiz we took but I was careless and still got it wrong; that alone would've brought the score up to a 92% and help pull my overall average up above 90%.  With my overall score floating around 90%, I'm a little worried that I won't make the cut there, but I'm hoping after some more assignments and a kick-ass project that I'll be ok in the end!
