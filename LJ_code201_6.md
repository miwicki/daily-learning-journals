# **Daily Learning Journal 6**

## Feel a lot more caught up now! I still need to make finishing touches on the bus mall and salmon cookie project but I think I'm really close to being totoally complete in time for this sunday!  I just want to ensure I have enough time for the exam and to prepare for the project! It's all winding down now!!
