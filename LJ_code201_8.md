# **Daily Learning Journal 8**

##Today was great! Our group got so much don eon the project, like the content and functionality for the whole first page out of 3/4 we were planning on doing.  Plus, this is the first day I have experienced where I or my partner/group hasn't had to ask a TA for help fixing anything, so I'm really confident in our groups success and comforted that I might be getting better at troubleshooting my own problems and solving them on my own or with collaboration :) can't wait to get the fight page completed tomorrow!
