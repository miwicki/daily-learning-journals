# **Daily Learning Journal Day 20**

Really happy with how our presentation went! Considering none of us are natural public speakers I think it went pretty darn well. No one really slipped up on their words and it looked like everybody enjoyed our app.  Overall the class did a great job as well, it looked like every group finished their projects free of bugs and presented them well too.  I'm happy to get a week off for sure, but I'm also excited to see everybody again in 301.  It sounded like a class that I'll really enjoy, as it looks to be mostly pair and group programming which is where I flourished the best in 201.  Now that I have a solid foundation for how to properly learn coding and how to work through problems properly, whether that be on my own, or with a partner, group, or TA, I think I'm prepared for the next class and I can't wait to learn more!
