# **LJ Code 201 - Day 2**

##So far it has been a lot of the beginning and introductory material, which so far hasn't been the smoothest but it's all worked out in the end! Even with trying to work with gitbash and github to get file transfers working properly, it's been a struggle at times.  However, with the new struggles of today, I've found that I'm much more proficient with html, css, and js, where I was having more troubles with those yesterday.  It really makes me excited to learn and have new challenges tomorrow, just so I can laugh at how I once thought using the terminal and github was difficult.

##BRING IT ON!
